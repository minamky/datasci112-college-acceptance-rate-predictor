# datasci112-college-acceptance-rate-predictor
Mina Ky and Stephanie Loekman's final project for DATASCI 112 in which we analyzed college admissions test statistics and demographics to predict acceptance rates for schools that do not report.
We also created a dot plot visualization of every flagship college location and their respective acceptance rate as well as a choropleth map that shows the number of elite colleges in each state.
