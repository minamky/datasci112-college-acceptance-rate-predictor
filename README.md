# datasci112-college-acceptance-rate-predictor
Mina Ky and Stephanie Loekman's final project for DATASCI 112 in which we analyzed college admissions test statistics and demographics to predict acceptance rates for schools that do not report.
We also created a dot plot visualization of every flagship college location and their respective acceptance rate as well as a choropleth map that shows the number of elite colleges in each state.

Research Question: As more and more colleges attempt to withhold or hide their admission rate, how can potential applicants predict the admission rate for colleges that don't report? Additionally, how can you find colleges that are similiar to ones you have already gotten into? This project attempts to analyze how closely related a number of factors are to a schools admissions rate through visualizations and machine learning models.
